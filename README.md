# ULang

This project is a personal experiment aimed at implementing a language with a very limited set of primitives, 
yet full expressiveness, that can be easily mapped to other programming languages, providing a foundation for writing portable libraries.
The language currently is a subset of golang which means that it is implemented using golang syntax and its abstractions.
