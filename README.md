# ULang

This project is a personal experiment aimed at implementing a Go language transpiler that provides a foundation for writing portable libraries.
Currently, only a limited set of primitives is supported for transpilation. The goal is to gradually extend this subset over time.
Ultimately, some features might remain unsupported due to the lack of corresponding primitives on the target platform.
